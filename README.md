# GNSS (data pipeline)

This repository aims to describe the processing of GNSS data in order to obtain TEC (total electronic content) maps of the ionosphere. The TEC can be expressed by the integral of the number of electrons along the optical path between the satellite and the receiver, that is:

$$ TEC = \int_{\text{receiver}}^{\text{satellite}} N_e \cdot ds$$

## Ionospheric Piercing Point -IPP



## Cycle-Slips detection


## Relative TEC - RTE

## Temporal rate of TEC


### ROT

$$ ROT = \frac{TEC_{t_2} - TEC_{t_1}}{\Delta t}$$

### ROTI
